# Overview: crime-demos

Crime demos is collection of apps that demonstrate some of the things you can do with the open crime data we publish in a [world-readable Cloudant database](https://opendata.cloudant.com/crimes). There's also a [documented public API](https://opendata.mybluemix.net/static/crimes.html) for accessing the data programmatically. 

## How it works

The application uses these Bluemix services:

* a Node.js runtime


## Running the app on Bluemix

The fastest way to deploy this application to Bluemix is to click the **Deploy to Bluemix** button below.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://deployment-tracker.mybluemix.net/stats/2956f80082fb32656c54ebba001dbdf3/button.svg)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/crime-demos)

**Don't have a Bluemix account?** If you haven't already, you'll be prompted to sign up for a Bluemix account when you click the button.  Sign up, verify your email address, then return here and click the the **Deploy to Bluemix** button again. Your new credentials let you deploy to the platform and also to code online with Bluemix and Git. If you have questions about working in Bluemix, find answers in the [Bluemix Docs](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/).

## Running the app locally

Clone this repository then run `npm install` to add the Node.js libraries required to run the app.

Then run: `$ node app.js`

## Privacy Notice

The Crime demos web application includes code to track deployments to Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/cf-deployment-tracker-service) service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

### Disabling Deployment Tracking

For manual deploys, deployment tracking can be disabled by removing `require("cf-deployment-tracker-client").track();` from the end of the `app.js` main server file.
